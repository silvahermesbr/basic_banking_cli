# Whats this?

## Motivation
    This is a basic c++ project I had in mind for some time, I really wanted to create something to put up to my github after so many other projects being essentially shafted thanks to my "trigger finger" on the rm -rf ./projects after I decide to simply switch programming languages.

    After some time I decided to stick with C++ at first to become proficient at it not because it is easy but rather for the challenge.
    Other languages offer package managers (looking at you npm) but I think that if I can figure this thing out, I will be able to figure most things out.

    I don't really want to learn C++, I want to learn programming, and if learning C++ I am learning such a low level language as people say it is, then I am on the right track, I suppose.
    After talking with people that are far ahead of me in programming and also working with this thing, they all said I should start populating my github, so here goes nothing I guess...

## Techs involved
    
    Basic C++ std library and Sqlite C/C++ API. (check libs folder)
